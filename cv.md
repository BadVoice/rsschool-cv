#### Briefly About Myself:

Got to know IT in 2018 when reading the PHP 7 book.
After that I began to study HTML, CSS for 4 years, dropping out and resuming the study.

During all this time I tried different languages like C# and tried to find myself.

I believe, that my ability to learn and my found path will lead me through this of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

### Code example:

__Duplicate Encoder from CODEWARS:__
*The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.*

<pre>
    const duplicateEncode = (word) => {
    const symbols = word.toLowerCase().split('') // ['r' 'e' 'c' 'e' 'd']

    return symbols.map((el) => {
    const filterSymbols = symbols.filter((els) => els === el).length > 1

    if (filterSymbols)
    return ')'
    else
    return '('

    }).join('')
    }
</pre>
